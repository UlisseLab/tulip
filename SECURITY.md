# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please only report issues that are present in the latest commit on the master branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

As this is an A/D CTF tool, most people will not run long-term publicly reachable instances. As such, feel free to report security issues directly in the github issues tracker.
